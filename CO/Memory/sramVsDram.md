SRAM: SRAM stores information when power is supplied.
DRAM: DRAM stores information for few miliseconds after the power is supplied
SRAM: Bits stored in a form of voltage 
DRAM: Bits stored in a form of electric charge
SRAM: Uses flipflops to store data and many transistors
DRAM: Uses capacitors to store data and few transistors
SRAM: No issue of charge leakage so don't have to refreshed
DRAM: Do have chances of data leakage so have to refresh
SRAM: Consume more power.
DRAM: Consume less power.
SRAM: Faster 
DRAM: Slower
SRAM: Used in Cache memory
DRAM: Used in RAM like DDR4
