Words: In memory to store each bit we have cells and a fixed no of cell is in 
group is called a word. 
Address: For easy access every word assigned with an address.
word length: No of bits in each word is called word length
A word can group of 8 bits = 1 byte, 16 bits = 2 byte, 32 bits = 4 bytes, 64 
bits = 8 bytes.


quick math:
    sizeof memory = 64kb
    every word = 1 byte 
    simply 64 kb x 1 byte
    find addess line
=> 64kb x 1 byte = 64 kb x 8bit = 2^6 * 2^10(cause KB) = 2^16 (cause wanted
address line) = 16 address bit 

if wanted data line = 8 bits
