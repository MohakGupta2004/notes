Addressing Modes: Different ways to specify the location of the operands
are called Addressing modes.
It specifies a rule to interpret or modify the address field of the 
instruction before operand is actually referenced.


Instruction Cycle: It's the cycle by how a instruction is executed.
    1. Fetch Instruction: The instruction is fetched from the memory
    and the program counter.
    2. Decode Instruction: The instruction is decoded and the program
    counter stores the address of the next instruction.
    3. Execute: The instruction which is decoded starts to execute.

Program Counter: PC stores the address of the next instruction which 
will be executed. PC is incremented each time an instruction is fetched.
