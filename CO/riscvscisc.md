CISC: This provides a large no of instruction set which is optimal
for complex tasks.
RISC: This provides a small no of instruction set. The philosophy
behind this is simplicity. Mostly used in microprocessors.
CISC: Complext Instrcution Set Computing.
RISC: Reduced Instruction set computing.
CISC: Has a large no of Instruction sets.
RISC: Has a small no of instruction sets.
CISC: Take more clock cycles for executing an instruction.
RISC: Takes less clock cycles.
CISC: Has a variable no of instruction sets.
RISC: This has a fixed no of instruction sets.
CISC: General purpose registers are not used mostly.
RISC: General purpose registers are mostly used.
CISC: Pipeling is difficult.
RISC: Pipelining is easier.
CISC: Many addressing modes.
RISC: Less addressing modes.
