LDAP is more like an authentication database. Like it stores the username and password in a hierarchical manner like a directory. It uses in the intranet. It does user authentication.

Basically don't create your account, we are gonna provide you.

_@Actual Definition@_
Lightweight Directory Access Protocol is used for accessing directory across distributed services. Hierarchical structure is used in Active Directory for listing. LDAP uses port 389. It creates session by connecting to a Directory System Agent and sends an operation request. The info is shared in basic encoding format (not encryption).   

## LDAP ENUMERATION 

When attackers perform LDAP enumeration, they're trying to:

- **List all users** (find who's in the system).
- **List groups** (see what permissions they might have).
- **Snoop for other sensitive details** (like email addresses, phone numbers, job titles).
As an attacker we try to gather info about user names addresses etc.
