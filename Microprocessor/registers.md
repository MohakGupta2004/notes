### ðŸ”¹ Introduction:

The **8085 microprocessor** contains several **internal registers** which are essential for executing instructions, performing operations, and handling data. These registers can be categorized into **general-purpose**, **special-purpose**, and **temporary/internal** registers.

### ðŸ”¹ List and Functions of Internal Registers:

| **Register**                                     | **Size**             | **Function**                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| **Accumulator (A)**                              | 8-bit                | - Primary register used in **arithmetic, logical, and data transfer** operations. <br> - Stores **results of operations** performed by the ALU.                                                                                  |
| **General Purpose Registers (B, C, D, E, H, L)** | 8-bit each           | - Temporary **data storage** during program execution. <br> - Can be used individually (8-bit) or as register pairs: **BC, DE, HL** (16-bit).                                                                                    |
| **Program Counter (PC)**                         | 16-bit               | - Holds the **memory address of the next instruction** to be executed. <br> - Automatically increments after fetching each instruction.                                                                                          |
| **Stack Pointer (SP)**                           | 16-bit               | - Points to the **top of the stack** in memory. <br> - Used in **CALL, RET, PUSH, POP** instructions.                                                                                                                            |
| **Instruction Register (IR)**                    | 8-bit                | - Temporarily holds the **opcode** of the instruction being executed. <br> - Not accessible to the programmer.                                                                                                                   |
| **Temporary Register**                           | 8-bit                | - Used **internally by the ALU** for intermediate results. <br> - Not user-accessible.                                                                                                                                           |
| **Flag Register (F)**                            | 8-bit (5 flags used) | - Stores the **status flags** affected after operations. <br> - Contains: <br> Â Â ðŸ”¹ **Sign flag (S)** <br> Â Â ðŸ”¹ **Zero flag (Z)** <br> Â Â ðŸ”¹ **Auxiliary carry (AC)** <br> Â Â ðŸ”¹ **Parity flag (P)** <br> Â Â ðŸ”¹ **Carry flag (CY)** |
| **W and Z Registers**                            | 8-bit each           | - Temporary registers used **internally** (e.g., during `XCHG` instruction). <br> - Not directly accessible.                                                                                                                     |

### ðŸ”¹ Flags in Detail (in Flag Register):

| **Flag**           | **Set When**                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Sign (S)**       | Result is **negative** (MSB = 1)                                               |
| **Zero (Z)**       | Result is **zero**                                                             |
| **Aux Carry (AC)** | Carry is generated **from bit 3 to bit 4** in binary addition                  |
| **Parity (P)**     | Result has **even number of 1s** â†’ flag is 1; **odd number of 1s** â†’ flag is 0 |
| **Carry (CY)**     | An **overflow** occurs in the MSB (bit 7) during addition/subtraction          |

### ðŸ”¹ Conclusion:
The internal registers of the 8085 are crucial for its **operation, control, and data processing**. Some are **user-accessible**, like general-purpose registers, while others are **used internally**, like W, Z, and Temporary registers.
