## ðŸ”¹ Control Unit of 8085 Microprocessor

### ðŸ”¸ Definition:

The **Control Unit (CU)**, as the name suggests, **coordinates and generates control signals** required for the operation of the microprocessor. It ensures proper execution of instructions by managing the flow of data between CPU, memory, and I/O devices.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Functions of the Control Unit:

* **Instruction Fetch** â€“ Retrieves instruction from memory.
* **Instruction Decode** â€“ Decodes the fetched instruction to determine operation and operands.
* **Control Signal Generation** â€“ Produces control signals required for executing instructions.
* **Execution Coordination** â€“ Activates appropriate circuits (ALU, registers, memory, etc.).
* **Status Monitoring** â€“ Tracks and updates status lines and flags during execution.

---

### ðŸ”¸ Clock System and Pins:

* The **8085 microprocessor** has **X1 and X2 pins** connected to a **crystal oscillator**.
* The crystal oscillator operates at **6 MHz**.
* An internal **clock generator** divides this by 2, producing a **3 MHz clock** used by the processor.
* The **Control Unit** uses this clock to generate **precise control signals**.

### ðŸ”¸ Various Types of Control Signals:

#### 1. **ALE (Address Latch Enable)**

* Used to **separate address from data** on the multiplexed bus (AD0â€“AD7).
  \| ALE State | Operation                                  |
  \|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
  \| `1`       | AD0â€“AD7 carry **lower-order address**       |
  \| `0`       | AD0â€“AD7 act as **data bus**                 |

---

#### 2. **RDÌ… (Read Control Signal)**

* Enables data to be read from memory or I/O device.
  \| RDÌ… State | Meaning         |
  \|-----------|-----------------|
  \| `0`       | **Read enabled**|
  \| `1`       | **Read disabled**|

---

#### 3. **WRÌ… (Write Control Signal)**

* Allows data to be written to memory or I/O device.
  \| WRÌ… State | Meaning          |
  \|-----------|------------------|
  \| `0`       | **Write enabled**|
  \| `1`       | **Write disabled**|

---

#### 4. **IO/MÌ… (I/O or Memory Selection)**

* Distinguishes between **memory and I/O operations**.
  \| IO/MÌ… State | Operation Type  |
  \|------------|------------------|
  \| `0`        | **Memory**       |
  \| `1`        | **I/O**          |

### ðŸ”¸ Control Signal Combinations and Their Meaning:

| IO/MÌ… | RDÌ… | WRÌ… | Operation    | Signal Name |
| ----- | --- | --- | ------------ | ----------- |
| `0`   | `0` | `1` | Memory Read  | MEMRÌ…       |
| `0`   | `1` | `0` | Memory Write | MEMWÌ…       |
| `1`   | `0` | `1` | I/O Read     | IORÌ…        |
| `1`   | `1` | `0` | I/O Write    | IOWÌ…        |

---

### ðŸ”¸ Status Lines (S1 and S0):

These lines indicate the **current operation status** of the microprocessor.

| IO/MÌ… | S1 | S0 | Operation             |
| ----- | -- | -- | --------------------- |
| `0`   | 0  | 1  | Memory Write          |
| `0`   | 1  | 0  | Memory Read           |
| `1`   | 0  | 1  | I/O Write             |
| `1`   | 1  | 0  | I/O Read              |
| `0`   | 1  | 1  | Opcode Fetch          |
| `1`   | 1  | 1  | Interrupt Acknowledge |
| `Z`   | 0  | 0  | Halt                  |
| `Z`   | X  | X  | Hold or Reset state   |

### ðŸ”¸ What is `Z` (High Impedance State)?

* The **High Impedance (Z) state** means the pin is effectively **disconnected** from the circuit.
* **Voltage levels:**

  * `0` = 0.0V to 0.18V (Logic Low)
  * `1` = 3.33V to 5.32V (Logic High)
  * `Z` = 0.19V to 3.32V (Neither high nor low â€” floating state)
