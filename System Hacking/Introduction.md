▰ System hacking is the way hackers get access to individual
computers on a network. Ethical hackers learn system hacking
to detect, prevent, and counter these types of attacks.
▰ It is the procedure of obtaining unauthorized access to a system
and its resources, exploiting the weaknesses in a computer
system.
▰ Generally use password cracking, viruses, malware, Trojans,
worms, phishing techniques, email spamming, social
engineering, exploit operating system vulnerabilities, to get
access to any victim's system.

### Goals of System Hacking:
▻ Gaining Access
▻ Escalating privileges
▻ Executing applications
▻ Hiding files
▻ Clearing tracks

### Password Cracking:
▰ Password cracking techniques are used to recover passwords
from computer systems.
▰ Attackers use password cracking techniques to gain
unauthorized access to the vulnerable system.
▰ Most of the password cracking techniques are successful due to
weak or easily guessable passwords.

### Password Strength
▻ 2015 annual public sector information security survey says “Weak
authentication security is the leading cause of data breaches,
accounting for 76% of compromised records.”
▻ Complexity defines the character set used.
▻ Length is a crucial factor, over complexity, c0mpl3x can be cracked
much faster than thisismypasswrd.
▻ The formula is log(C) / log(2) * L where C is the size of the character
set and L the length of the password

### Types of password attacks
▰ Non-Electronic Attacks: Attacker need not posses technical knowledge
to crack password, hence known as non-technical attack.
▻ Shoulder Surfing
▻ Social Engineering
▻ Dumpster Diving

▰ Active Online Attacks: Attacker performs password cracking by directly
communicating with the victim machine.
▻ Dictionary and Brute Forcing Attack
▻ Hash Injection and Phishing
▻ Trojan/Spyware/Keyloggers
▻ Password Guessing

▰ Passive Online Attacks: Attacker performs password cracking without
communicating with the authorizing party.
▻ Wire Sniffing (Eavesdropping)
▻ Replay

▰ Offline Attack: Attacker copies the target's password file and then tries
to crack passwords in his own system at different location.
▻ Pre-Computed Hashes (Rainbow Table)
▻ Distributed Network

▰ Non-Electronic Attacks
▻ Shoulder Surfing: Looking at either the user's keyboard or screen
while he/she is logging in.
▻ Social Engineering: Convincing people to reveal passwords
▻ Dumpster Diving: Searching for sensitive information at the user's
trash-bins, printer trash bins, and user desk for sticky notes.
