Sparse matrix is a kind of matrix where most of the elements are 0.

Because of more no of zero's we're representing similar kind of data and repetation happens a lot with this.
So space is wasted more.

example: sparse matrix is used on adjacency matrix as a representation of graph.
         Also can be used for machine learning and data visualization. NLP.
