bfs is mostly used because it traverses the graph in a level by level order which gives it a advantage of doing
operations with the path. Basically finding the longest or the shortest path.

Shortest Path finding:
    BFS is mostly used for it's shortest path traversal.
    example: navigation systems like google maps.

Web crawling:
    BFS is also used for web crawling making it easier to explore related web pages by assigning it to a weighted 
    graph which gives the mobility to make websites more foundable.
    example: a web scrawler.

Broadcasting in networks:
    routers and packets uses bfs to find the shortest path between two networks.
