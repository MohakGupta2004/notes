DFS: choose one branch and explore the rest of it
BFS: choose one node and explore every branch of it
DFS: uses recursion and stack
BFS: doesn't required recursion we can use queue for it
DFS: not optimal for finding the shortest path
BFS: optimal for finding the shortest path
DFS: depth orientend
BFS: breath orientend
DFS: for finding all possible path
BFS: ideal for finding shortest path used more in networking
