Rebalancing in an AVL tree is necessary when the tree becomes unbalanced due to an insertion or deletion operation. The balance factor of a node in an AVL tree must always be in the range of -1 to +1. If the balance factor of any node goes outside this range (i.e., -2 or +2), it indicates that the tree is unbalanced and needs rebalancing.
Conditions that Trigger Rebalancing:

Rebalancing is triggered when an operation causes the balance factor of a node to exceed the allowable range of -1 to +1. This imbalance can be caused by the following two types of situations:

    Insertion
    Deletion
