AVL tree is a kind of a BST which is balanced the reason why it's here because it maintains the O(logn) time complexity
which can be interrupted by O(n) linkedlist format which can happen accidently but AVL tree restricts it by making sure
a particular node has a balance factor between {-1,0,1}


BALACE FACTOR: height of the left subtree - height of the right subtree.

Whenever an imbalance happens it causes a rebalance to make it right.
Rebalance are rotatations 
1. LL, RR, LR, RL
