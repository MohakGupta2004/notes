Using lot of recursion cause a lot of functions to go and pushed to stack which makes the stack overflow and memory
overhead.

which causes performace overload 

debugging become hard because of recursive function calls.

potential for infinite recursion: poorly written base cases


(Mostly stack overflow and memory overhead)
