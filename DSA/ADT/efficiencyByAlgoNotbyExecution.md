Efficiency of an algo is often analyzed based on problem size because every system has it's own kind of execution time
but the approach while analyzing an algorithm defines that it's going to be relative in a variable format.

Platform: It depens on hardware and the software and we can't generalize it.
Time complexity: To get out of this problem we use time complexity as a standard.
