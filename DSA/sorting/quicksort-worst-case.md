Quicksort worst case occurs when it encounters a already sorted array. It creates time complexity O(n^2) which usually
is O(nlogn).

solution: choose random pivot elements and implement a universal algorithm for finding the pivot.
          choose proper sorting method for simiilar kind of purposes like if using Merge sort it'll
            take O(nlogn) in every case
