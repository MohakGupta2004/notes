'this' is a special keyword refers to the default current object instance inside a class.

1. Accessing current object's members:
  - "this" refers to the current object so you can access the members inside the class via "this"

2. Returns current object:
 - if you return "this" then you can do method chaining with it.

3. Avoids ambiguity:
 - When function arguments or local variables have the same name then we can define the values of it using "this"
