Encapsulation is core concept of OOPS which is basically all about encapsulating the logic at a single place so that we can use it for different cases.

1. Data Hiding/Securing: 
  - Internal object state is hidden from the user.
  - Only allowed methods can access and modify data.
  (like getters, setters)

2. Improved Maintainability:
  - Code doesn't mix up between methods, internal implementation doesn't affect any outer code.
  - We can update logic without previous logic break.

3. Readability:
  - Code becomes really readable after encapsulating based on the requirements.

4. Abstraction:
  - hides internal logic and provide essential features for the user.
