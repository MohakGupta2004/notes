This format makes it **objective + flexible**. You can also use **Obsidian Dataview plugin** to auto-aggregate candidate scores into a dashboard (like a comparison chart).

üëâ Do you want me to also create a **radar chart visualization** (skills mapping) template for each candidate inside Obsidian, so you can quickly compare multiple candidates visually?
